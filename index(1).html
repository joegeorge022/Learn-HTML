      This is a paragraph. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard
      language used to create web pages. The "html" tag defines the root of the
      document, and within it, the "head" section contains meta-information like
      the "title" tag, which sets the page's title displayed in the browser tab.
      The "body" tag holds the visible content of the page, such as headings
      ("h1" to "h6"), paragraphs ("p"), line breaks ("br"), and other structural
      elements. Attributes provide additional details about elements, such as
      "id" or "class" for styling or identification purposes. Comments, written
      within "<!--comment-->", allow developers to leave notes in the code
      without affecting how the page renders. These tags and attributes together
      form the foundation of a web page.
